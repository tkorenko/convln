+ Rewrite tree traversal: use dirpointers instead of fullnames;
+ Add config structure
+ Move iconv's stuff to a separate module (file): meet nameconv.[ch]
+ A BUG: a utility should avoid from tree traversal its own destination
  directory
+ Create man(1) page (man mdoc ; files mkdir.1, stat.1 might serve as
  examples)

- Bring in Zed Shaw's error handling macros;

- Error handling revisited

- I've to think over variable names (of the entire project)

- Debug verbosity switch is requested
